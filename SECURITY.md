# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest release and the `main` branch for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email security@umicom.foundation with details. We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours.

If your report includes sensitive information, please indicate so, and we will coordinate a private fix and disclosure timeline.

## Best Practices
- Avoid using insecure CRT variants on Windows; prefer safe wrappers or our shared helpers.
- Keep dependencies minimal and up to date.
